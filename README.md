# AI-Powered-Chatbot-for-Custom-Knowledge-Base
This project demonstrates the development of an AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions based on a custom knowledge base. The chatbot leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses.
This project demonstrates the development of an AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions based on a custom knowledge base. The chatbot leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses.

Key Features and Functionality:

Knowledge Base Loading and Processing: The code begins by loading a text file (demo.txt) containing the knowledge base information. It then utilizes the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from the langchain library to divide the text into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient processing.

Embedding and Vector Store Creation: To enable semantic search, the code employs sentence embeddings using the SentenceTransformerEmbeddings model from langchain. These embeddings represent the meaning of each text chunk as a vector. The vectors are then stored in a Chroma vector database for fast and efficient retrieval.

Question Answering with Retrieval Augmented Generation: The core of the chatbot's functionality lies in the RetrievalQA chain from langchain. This chain utilizes a retrieval mechanism to find relevant information from the vector database based on the user's question. The retrieved information is then combined with the user's question and fed into a large language model (LLM) for generating a comprehensive and informative answer.

Large Language Model Integration: The code integrates the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 LLM from Hugging Face using the HuggingFacePipeline class from langchain. This LLM is responsible for generating human-like responses based on the retrieved information and the user's query.

Interactive User Interface: The code includes a simple interactive loop that prompts the user to enter questions and displays the chatbot's responses. This allows users to engage in a conversation with the chatbot and receive answers tailored to their specific inquiries.

Technical Stack:

Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
Langchain: A framework for developing applications powered by language models.
Hugging Face Transformers: A library for accessing and utilizing pre-trained language models.
ChromaDB: A vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.
Sentence Transformers: A library for generating sentence embeddings.
Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1: A powerful large language model from Hugging Face.
Potential Applications:

This AI-powered chatbot can be adapted for a variety of use cases, including:

Customer Support: Providing automated responses to frequently asked questions.
Information Retrieval: Enabling users to easily access information from a large knowledge base.
Education: Delivering personalized learning experiences.
Research: Assisting researchers in exploring and understanding complex dataset
2. image classification using neural network 
This code is a basic example of image classification using a neural network in TensorFlow and Keras. It uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains images of 10 different classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Import necessary libraries:

tensorflow and keras for building and training the neural network.
numpy for numerical operations.
matplotlib for plotting images.
Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset:

Loads the CIFAR-10 dataset using keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data().
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Normalizes the pixel values of the images to a range of 0 to 1. This is a common preprocessing step to improve model performance.
Define the neural network model:

Creates a sequential model using keras.Sequential().
Adds layers to the model:
A flattening layer to convert the 2D images into 1D vectors.
A dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation function.
An output layer with 10 neurons (one for each class) and softmax activation function.
Display sample images and labels:

Uses matplotlib.pyplot to display sample images from the dataset.
Prints the labels of the displayed images.
(Implied) Compile and train the model:

Although not shown in the code you provided, the next steps would typically involve compiling the model (specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metrics) and then training it using the training data.
(Implied) Evaluate the model:

After training, the model would be evaluated on the testing data to measure its performance.
In essence, the code sets up a neural network to learn patterns from the CIFAR-10 images and classify new images into one of the 10 categories. Let me know if you have other questions.
